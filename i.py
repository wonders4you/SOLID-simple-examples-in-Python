# I - interface segregation principle

# Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

# Many dedicated interfaces are better than the general one. The principle of segregation
# interfaces is primarily designed to eliminate bulky, unnecessarily complex interfaces, 
# so that instances do not call unused  methods.
